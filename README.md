# Grid 3-Phase AC/DC Converter with Dynamic Load and DC-DC Converter

## Project Overview
This MATLAB/Simulink project models a 3-phase AC/DC converter system with a dynamic load and a DC-DC converter. The system is designed to simulate power conversion and regulation in a grid-connected scenario.

## Project Structure
- **grid_3phase_acdc_convertor_dynamicload_Dc_Dc_Convertor.slx** - Main Simulink model file
- **simulink/** - Simulink system files and configuration
  - `blockdiagram.xml` - Block diagram definitions
  - `configSet0.xml` - Configuration sets
  - `modelDictionary.xml` - Model dictionary
  - `systems/system_root.xml` - System root definitions
- **metadata/** - Project metadata files

## Requirements
- MATLAB (R2020b or later recommended)
- Simulink
- Power Systems Toolbox (optional, for advanced features)

## Getting Started
1. Open MATLAB
2. Navigate to the project directory: `d:\ASSIGNMENTS AB\PRJOECT 37`
3. Open the model file: `grid_3phase_acdc_convertor_dynamicload_Dc_Dc_Convertor.slx`
4. Run the simulation to see the 3-phase AC/DC converter operation

## Key Features
- 3-phase AC/DC power conversion
- Dynamic load modeling
- DC-DC converter integration
- Grid synchronization control

## Usage
- Modify simulation parameters in the model workspace
- Adjust converter and control settings as needed
- Run simulations to analyze system performance
- Export results for further analysis
